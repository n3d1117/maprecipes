# Overview
- **Academic Year**: 2020-2021
- **Project Title**: MapRecipes: implementation and usability testing of a web application using the Vue.js framework
- **CFUs**: 9

In this project we implemented a working prototype of a web application (MapRecipes) for cataloguing and geolocalizing italian recipes.

# Tools and Techniques
The main tools and techniques used are:
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org): for building the user interface and single-page application
- [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org): for building a responsive interface using Bootstrap v4
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com): for integrating a mobile-friendly interactive map
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com): for web hosting and automated deployment

# Expected Outcomes
We expect the following outcomes from this project:
- Working prototype of the application, publicly accessible from the Web. This will consist in a single-page web application, implemented with a responsive layout to ensure a great user experience even on mobile devices with smaller screens. This prototype will use static data and it should be able to demonstrate the main features and use cases.
- Results from Usability Testing, which should hopefully help us in identifying potential issues and improvements to be made.

# Summary
The idea for this project was born from the mutual interest in the gastronomic field. The intent was to discover and catalog, also from a geographical point of view, recipes from all over Italy, representing the culinary traditions of the different regions.

Our goal is to make the final product as easy, accessible and user friendly as possible, for people of any age.
